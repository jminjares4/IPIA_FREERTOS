## **Hardware**
The *printed circuit board* (`PCB`) was developed using EagleCAD. This is the first iteration of the pcb and few changes are need.

* **Future Work**
  * [ ] Change `through-hole` components to `surface mount`
  * [ ] Add `JTAG` interface
  * [ ] Update `lithium-ion` battery connection
  * [ ] Change `TP4056` linear battery charger to more capable charger
  * [ ] Create footprint for `SIM33EAU` (GPS Module)
